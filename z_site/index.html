            About semi-cooperative education
            
            The school is founded on the concept of semi-cooperative nursery education.
            
            Parents are members of a non-profit, non-sectarian corporation that administers the school through an appointed board of trustees. That may sound scary, but it's great! Parents have the opportunity to guide their child’s first school experience as they share in decision making and committee service.
            
            For information on the school structure, see the abbreviated description of committees document. The school by-laws provide detailed information about parental responsibilities, financial commitments, and refund policies. The Parent's Handbook is an indispensable resource for parents whose children are currently enrolled.
            
            The Winton Road Nursery School admits students of both sexes and of any race, creed, color and national or ethnic background. A small number of scholarships are awarded based on financial need.
